# Effective thinking through Maths #

## Week 0 ##

### Understanding deeply ###
Don't face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don't know. Then see what's missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notion. There are degrees to understanding (it's not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success.

### Make mistakes ###
Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes are great teachers - they highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding. They also show you which way to turn next, and they ignite your imagination.

### Raise questions ###
Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding. What's the real question? Working on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime. Ideas are in the air - the right questions will bring them out and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible.

### Follow the flow of ideas ###
Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. A new idea is a beginning, not an end. Ideas are rare - milk them. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs.

### The quintessential element ###
The unchanging element is change - by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning.


## Week 1: Meanie Genie ##
On an archeological dig near the highlands of Tibet, Alley discovered an ancient oil lamp. Just for laughs she rubbed the lamp. She quickly stopped laughing when a huge puff of magenta smoke spouted from the lamp, and an ornery genie named Murray appeared. Murray, looking at the stunned Alley, exclaimed, “Well, what are you staring at? Okay, okay, you’ve found me; you get your three wishes. So, what will they be?” Alley, although in shock, realized she had an incredible oppor- tunity. Thinking quickly, she said, “I’d like to find the Rama Nujan, the jewel that was first discovered by Hardy the High Lama.” “You got it,” replied Murray, and instantly nine identical-looking stones appeared. Alley looked at the stones and was unable to differentiate any one from the others.

Finally she said to Murray, “So where is the Rama Nujan?” Murray explained, “It is embedded in one of these stones. You said you wished to find it. So now you get to find it. Oh, by the way, you may take only one of the stones with you, so choose wisely!” “But they look identical to me. How will I know which one has the Rama Nujan in it?” Alley questioned. “Well, eight of the stones weigh the same, but the stone containing the jewel weighs slightly more than the others,” Murray responded with a devilish grin.

Alley, becoming annoyed, whispered under her breath, “Gee, I wish I had a balance scale.” Suddenly a balance scale appeared. “That was wish two!” declared Murray. “Hey, that’s not fair!” Alley cried. “You want to talk fair? You think it’s fair to be locked in a lamp for 1729 years? You know you can’t get cable TV in there, and there’s no room for a satellite dish! So don’t talk to me about fair,” Murray exclaimed. Realizing he had gone a bit overboard, Murray proclaimed, “Hey, I want to help you out, so let me give you a tip: That balance scale may be used only once.” “What? Only once?” she said, thinking out loud. “I wish I had another balance scale.” ZAP! Another scale appeared. “Okay, kiddo, that was wish three,” Murray snickered. “Hey, just one minute,” Alley said, now regretting not having asked for one million dollars or something more standard. “Well at least this new scale works correctly, right?” “Sure, just like the other one. You may use it only once.” “Why?” Alley inquired. “Because it is a ‘wished’ balance scale,” he said, “so the rule is ‘one scale, one balancing’; it’s just like the rule against using one wish to wish for a hundred more wishes.” “You are a very obnoxious genie.” “Hey, I don’t make up the rules, lady, I just follow them,” he said.

# Reflecting and responding #
This puzzle's statement has many complications and aspects to it. Understanding what exactly is being asked is a great place to start thinking about a question. Uncovering the essence involves specifying what cannot be ignored and identifying and ignoring all of the distracting features that should be ignored.

For me personally this puzzle was easy, didn't take me long to find the same answer as in the course.

# Answer #
* Split the rocks into groups of 3.
* Weigh group 1 and group 2. If one is heavier it contains the Ramanujan, and if
they are the same mass, the Ramanujan is in the 3rd group.
* Weigh the Ramanujan group with 1:1. If one is heavier it's the Ramanujan and if both weigh the same, the remaining rock is Ramanujan.
